## How to publish your research data in Yoda

This guide outlines the basic steps that are necessary for creating a data publication using Yoda. 

Yoda (short for ‘your data’) is a research data management service developed by Utrecht University 
that enables researchers to deposit, publish, and preserve their research data. 
This research data can be shared with collaborators or members of the research group, if needed. 
The steps to go from storing research data to a formal data publication that can be accessed 
and cited by others are outlined in the guide below. 

Once your data has been published in the Yoda repository, this is what happens:

- A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is assigned to the data package. This persistent identifier can be used 
to refer to the data package, e.g. in a scientific publication. 
You will receive the DOI assigned to your data package after publication is approved.

- The metadata of the data package will be published in data catalogues such as DANS NARCIS external and DataCite 
making your data publication Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable (FAIR).

- If the Access Type metadata field is set to 'Open - Freely retrievable', the data will be published as well. 
If the Access Type metadata field is set to 'Restricted' or 'Closed', only the metadata for the data set will 
be publicly available (recommended for sensitive data).
