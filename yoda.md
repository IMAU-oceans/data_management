# Quick start guide: How to publish your data on Yoda

## Introduction

Yoda is a data management system and stands for “Your Data”. Think of it as a way to store, manage, share, secure, add metadata and publish your research data. 

Yoda enables you to:

- Publish your dataset with a DOI enabling you to:
  - Refer to your dataset in articles or other datasets
  - Allowing access to your dataset (or not) 
  - Make your dataset findable in the Yoda Catalogue via its metadata
- Store your data for at least 10 years in a frozen state together with a standardized set of metadata
- Collaborate with fellow researchers on research data in a shared data storage

This short guide describes the steps a researcher needs to take to store and publish his/her research data on YODA with a DOI.
